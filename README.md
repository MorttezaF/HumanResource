In the name of Allah

This repository consists of two datasets tiers.csv and facilities.csv. File Task.py is also the main executable file of the program. 
This was done on Linux and on Apache Spark.
The purpose of using Apache Spark is to process these two datasets and answer the following question:

-	Join these two and store the resulting dataframe on disk.
-	We want to query tiers on a rectangular area by latitude and longitude.
